**This Github is for the Functional Genomics Final Project for 2024 **

In this main folder you will find (1) my "cheat_sheet" of useful code if you forget some basics for moving around on the command line, transfering data, and running scripts on the ASC; (2) the standard pipeline; and (3) folders for each Pipeline Group to share code. 

As you are troubleshooting, remember to check for your result files and the .error files to understand what went well, and what went wrong.

This Github will continue to be populated as we continue in th resoures
